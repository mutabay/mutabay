<strong>AI systems, software engineering, and data-driven applications</strong>.

This GitHub profile collects projects I’ve worked on during my studies and personal development.
They span areas such as web development, IoT and embedded Linux, machine learning,
natural language processing, and computer vision.
Some repositories are exploratory or educational by nature, others are more structured project work.
